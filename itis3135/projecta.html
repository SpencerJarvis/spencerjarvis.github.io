            <ol>
                <li>My website presents different restaurants in the Charlotte area for client Logan Duvick.</li>
                <li>The intended users of the website are Logan Duvick but also for people who wanted to see some restaurants that are more native to the Charlotte area.</li>

The home page will have links to the other webpages and overall introduce the user to the website and restaurants.</li>
