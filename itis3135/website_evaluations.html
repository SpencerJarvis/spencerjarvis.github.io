                <h3 class="web_evaluation_header"><a class="headerlink" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a></h3>
                <p>Amazon.com is a shopping website that allows users to purchase a wide array of items.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The website uses contrast correctly in none of the text is hard to read nor do different elements harm each other. The text is also contrasted correctly as the title and headers are larger than the description for each section other text.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Amazon uses repetition successfully as many of its sections are in uniform boxes making it very easy to go through. The fonts and colors of the fonts also repeat throughout the site.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The elements are lined up and organized on Amazon.com. Each section is aligned like they were on a grid with straight lines being common to the website.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The multiple categories have proper grouping on Amazon.com as the movie section, the fashion section, etc. are all grouped in their respective boxes. Nothing is too far away from itâ€™s section and none of the sections are too close that it would be confusing.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <br>
            <!--Bad Website-->
            <section>
                <h3 class="web_evaluation_header"><a class="headerlink" href="https://www.arngren.net/">Arngren.net</a></h3>
                <p>Arngent.net is a Norweign webiste that displays information about many different types of veichles.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Some of the text is hard to read as they are sometimes on top of images. Different elements have a hard time standing out from each other.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Arngren does not use repetition successfully as the website seems very random and confusing. There are too many colors for the fonts as well as it is not clear what is a header or a link or a description.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The elements are not lined up nor organized. There are no straight lines between texts or sections and there is very little visual connection between them.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: There is no proper related grouping on Arngen.com as it is very hard to tell where some sections end, and others begin. Different items are not given enough space to show that they are different.</li>
                </ul>
